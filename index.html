                    <p>

                        According to the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot> Wikipedia </a>, a Chatbot is a software application used to conduct an on-line chat conversation via text or text-to-speech, in lieu of providing direct contact with a live human agent. Designed to convincingly simulate the way a human would behave as a conversational partner, chatbot systems typically require continuous tuning and testing, and many in production remain unable to adequately converse or pass the industry standard Turing test. The term "ChatterBot" was originally coined by Michael Mauldin (creator of the first Verbot) in 1994 to describe these conversational programs.
                        <br><br>
                        Chatbots are used in dialog systems for various purposes including customer service, request routing, or information gathering. While some chatbot applications use extensive word-classification processes, natural language processors, and sophisticated AI, others simply scan for general keywords and generate responses using common phrases obtained from an associated library or database.
                        <br><br>
                        Most chatbots are accessed on-line via website popups or through virtual assistants. They can be classified into usage categories that include: commerce (e-commerce via chat), education, entertainment, finance, health, news, and productivity.

                    <li> <h3> How to build an useful Chatbot </h3></li>

                    <p>

                      Yogesh Moorjani From the <a href="https://chatbotsmagazine.com/?source=post_page-----b7fe3776c74c--------------------------------">
                      Chatbots Magazine </a> wrote an article called <a href="https://chatbotsmagazine.com/to-build-a-successful-chatbot-ask-these-5-questions-b7fe3776c74c">
                      To build a succesful chatbot ask these 5 questions</a> where he explained with 5 questions the main ideas on the creation of
                      a chatbot.
                      <br><br>
                      The questions were the next ones:
                      <br>
                        <ul id="facts">

                          <li style="color:black">What is the outcome I want for users of my product or service? </li>
                          <br>
                          <p>

                            He stands that when building a chatbot, you should not be looking to build just a "chair" you should look to build
                            a "chair" where people can rest on it. At the end, the chatbot is an instrument and asking this question you should find
                            the Why (to build it), "Which is the core of every action and every solution".

                          </p>

                          <li style="color:black">What is the business outcome you want to drive? </li>
                          <br>
                          <p>

                            Mr Moorjani says that you can build a chatbot thinking on the key outcomes of your business (even one key business outcome is
                            good). It could be to get a more larger and diverse user base, or customer retention and customer service. There are a lot
                            of things for chatbots to be useful, just find the one that fits your agenda.

                          </p>

                          <li style="color:black">Conversational UI (chatbots) are the best medium for your outcome? </li>
                          <br>
                          <p>

                            With all the existing media, such as (Websites, Youtube and other platforms) why should you pick chatbots to deliver
                            your business outcome. It could be the user interface, and the more personal way to treat your clients. It also could
                            be complementary to your website, with this question you should have a clear choice to build (or not) a chatbot.

                          </p>

                          <li style="color:black">Does your idea try to replace tasks that people love doing? </li>
                          <br>
                          <p>

                            When building your chatbot, think on the things that are more tedious for your clients. If you run an institute
                            for example, and you deployed a chatbot on your website the chatbot should answer the question of how much it costs
                            to study certain program if its asked so. And if people want more details it could answer with detail all the prices
                            that sums the program's price, its very common that students have to look at the details and they made their own sum.
                            <br><br>
                            Students may love to look for the programs and courses, but not to look all the details to the pricing.

                          </p>

                          <li style="color:black">Is the cost for using your chatbot-powered product or service less than the perceived value? </li>
                          <br>
                          <p>

                            Moorjani refers to the effort, attention, time and (perhaps) money it will require of users. He sets an example with her wife
                            and the purchase of an Amazon Echo, with the Echo they were capable to improve the way of making the list of the grocery store.
                            They used an app for the list that was always synced (online), using the Echo with a single voice command they could update their
                            list.
                            <br><br>
                            What was the improvement? they stopped to use the app on the phone where they spent time and effort, to talk with the virtual
                            assistant "Alexa" like it was a human ready to add items to the list, saving the time and effort they spent before.

                          </p>

                        </ul>


                    </p>
